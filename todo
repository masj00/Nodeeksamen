Add sockets end to end. Implement a feature that clearly uses socket.io (server + client) so you can demo real-time behavior.

(Socket.io now wraps Express and maintains a rolling “Study Room” message history, so any client can join and broadcast tips in real time (server/app.js (lines 1-108)). Each connection immediately receives the current history, and the server sanitizes/limits incoming payloads before emitting to everyone.

To support the new UI flow, the auth router exposes a logout endpoint that destroys the session and clears the cookie (server/routers/authRoutes.js (lines 120-129)).

The profile view is now the hub for real-time collaboration: after confirming the session it opens a socket.io-client connection, listens for history + live messages, and renders a chat feed plus send form; logout reuses the new API (client/src/pages/Profile.svelte (lines 1-120)).

Client dependencies include socket.io-client so remember to install/update packages (client/package.json (lines 16-21), run npm install inside client). Restart the server (npm run dev in server) so the new HTTP+Socket.IO setup takes effect, and run the Vite dev server to test chatting between two browsers.




Flesh out authorization beyond simple login. For example, admin-only routes/pages or role-based UI; enforce the same on the server.

Polish the UI/UX: replace the placeholder home page, style the login/signup/profile views, add clear flows and validation. Make sure you can demo several distinct user-facing features.

Remove dev-only logs/console output; ensure .env secrets aren’t committed. Add basic GDPR touches: cookie notice, clear data-handling info.

Document how to run the project (README) and test the DB access via terminal queries so you can demonstrate that during the exam.

Plan the demo: list 5–6 user-facing features you can show without diving into code, prep accounts (especially an already logged-in user), and make sure sockets/auth flows are smooth.

Why SQLite (informed choice)

Simple setup, no server needed
Works great with small web apps
Easy to inspect manually during exam
Already used in your project
Database commands (run in terminal)

From Eksamen/studyhelp/server, open the DB:
sqlite3 database.db

List tables:
.tables

Show schema:
.schema reminders
.schema users

Insert a reminder manually:
INSERT INTO reminders (user_id, title, reminder_date, reminder_time)
VALUES (1, 'Exam prep', '2026-02-15', '18:00');

List reminders for one user:
SELECT id, title, reminder_date, reminder_time
FROM reminders
WHERE user_id = 1
ORDER BY reminder_date, reminder_time;

Delete a reminder:
DELETE FROM reminders WHERE id = 1;

Exit:
.quit
